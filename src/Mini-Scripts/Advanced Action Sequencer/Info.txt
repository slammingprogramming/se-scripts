Core Feature Enhancements
Multi-Stage Sequencing and Conditional Triggers

Nested Sequences and Multi-Stage Actions: Allow the creation of multi-level sequences where actions can run one after another in a nested order, ideal for complex processes like multi-stage manufacturing or timed defensive responses.
Conditional Actions: Enable steps that only execute if a specific condition is met (e.g., checking a sensor, block status, or cargo level), creating a responsive sequence that adapts in real-time.
Loop Control: Allow sequences to loop a specific number of times, or continue indefinitely until a condition is met (such as a button press or enemy detection).
Increased Precision and Flexibility

Fine-Grained Delay Control: Offer delays in milliseconds to achieve ultra-precise timing, useful for synchronizing rapid-fire weapon sequences or timed assembly processes.
Variable Delays: Allow for dynamic delay times based on real-time data, such as resource levels, player input, or system status.
Sequencer “Pause” and “Resume” Functions: Incorporate the ability to pause and resume sequences without resetting, maintaining progress where it left off.
Real-Time Sequencer Feedback

Status Indicators and Progress Tracking: Display the current step of the sequence, total progress, and estimated time remaining on a display or LCD panel.
Error Handling and Alerts: Automatically detect if an action fails (e.g., due to a missing or unpowered block), and provide alerts or skip to the next viable action to ensure the sequence continues smoothly.
Expanded Block Control and Customization

Support for More Block Types: Expand control to include blocks like assemblers, refineries, hangar doors, and modded blocks, to enhance versatility across different engineering setups.
Grouped Block Actions: Allow users to assign actions to specific groups rather than individual blocks, simplifying programming for large-scale operations (like activating all lights in a room or turning off all reactors).
Slider and Property Adjustment: Integrate more in-depth control for blocks with adjustable sliders, enabling smooth transitions in rotor angles, piston positions, and thruster power over the course of the sequence.
User-Friendly Configuration Interface

Visual Script Editor: Create a simple UI for configuring actions, conditions, and timing in a “drag-and-drop” style or a text-based interface within Custom Data, making it easier for users unfamiliar with coding.
Customizable Sequence Profiles: Save different sequences as profiles that users can quickly switch between, ideal for adjusting the base’s functionality in different situations (e.g., factory mode, defense mode, or travel mode).
Preset Action Templates: Provide templates for common sequences (e.g., missile salvo, door lock/unlock, conveyor sorting) that users can select, customize, and deploy without starting from scratch.
Script and Power Efficiency Enhancements

Auto-Suspend Mode for Power Conservation: Place the sequencer in a low-power state when not in use, automatically activating when an external condition is met.
Sequencer Efficiency Adjustments: Optimize timing and code execution to reduce the script’s impact on server performance, with options for adjustable timing rates that fit the server’s simulation speed.
Advanced Simulated Automation and Responses

Sequencer Recalibration Based on Simulation Speed: Automatically adjust sequence timing to account for any changes in simulation speed, ensuring consistency and accuracy regardless of server load.
Modular Action Libraries: Allow users to save common actions (e.g., opening a hangar door, starting a reactor) as individual modules that can be easily reused and modified across multiple sequences.
New Applications and Advanced Functionality
Emergency Response Sequencing

Automated Shutdown or Defense Protocols: Configure sequences to respond to emergencies, like depressurization or power failure, by shutting down non-essential systems, activating shields, and closing hangar doors.
Automated Repair and Recovery Sequences: Set up sequences that activate repair blocks, realign solar panels, or reroute power to essential systems after detecting damage or critical status changes.
Coordination with Remote Systems

Networked Sequence Coordination: Synchronize sequences across multiple grids or vessels using antennas, allowing for coordinated launches, defense responses, or mining operations.
Remote Activation: Use communication between grids to remotely activate sequences on a separate structure or vehicle, enabling automated transport, dock handling, or drone operation.
Dynamic Resource Management and Manufacturing Chains

Inventory-Triggered Sequences: Use inventory sensors to automatically trigger sequences based on stock levels, such as initiating refineries when ore is available or launching cargo drones when containers are full.
Manufacturing Routines Based on Demand: Develop sequences that check inventory levels, automatically queue items in assemblers, and refine resources as needed, streamlining production based on current needs.
Interactive User-Controlled Sequencing

Interactive Sequence Control Console: Let users select and adjust sequences in real-time from a control console, perfect for large bases or capital ships where multiple sequences may be used at any time.
Handheld Remote Sequencing: Enable players to control sequences from their character’s HUD or a handheld terminal, allowing for on-the-go management.
Design Considerations
Simplicity vs. Flexibility: Balancing powerful features with an intuitive setup process to cater to users with varied skill levels.
Compatibility with Mods: Ensuring the script works seamlessly with both vanilla and popular modded blocks, enhancing its usability across different game setups.
Reliability Under Load: Prioritize efficient execution and minimal lag, especially for large multiplayer servers or highly populated grids.
