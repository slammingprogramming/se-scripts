Enhanced Features and Usability
Real-Time Jump Distance Adjustment

Dynamic Distance Scaling: Integrate real-time scaling of the jump distance based on the current situation (e.g., user-selected scale factor to increase or decrease the dialed distance in fractions).
Adaptive Distance Based on Power and Mass: Allow the script to calculate the maximum safe jump distance dynamically, taking into account current ship mass and power supply.
Advanced Input and Interface Options

Multi-LCD Display Support: Enable support for multiple LCD panels to show different information (e.g., jump distance on one panel, GPS coordinates on another, and jump status or cooldown on a third).
Customizable Hotkeys and Keybinding Profiles: Create predefined keybinding profiles (e.g., combat, exploration) to quickly switch between distance settings and jump modes.
Improved Locking and Safety Features

Auto-Distance Lock for Combat Situations: Automatically engage distance lock when hostile ships are detected, ensuring that sudden changes in ship mass (due to damage) do not affect jump distance.
Safety Lock with Mass and Power Alerts: Introduce a safety lock that prevents jumping if there is insufficient power or if mass suddenly changes, notifying the player of potential issues.
Cooldown Timer with Visual Indicator: Display a countdown timer on the LCD or HUD after each jump, indicating when the jump drive will be ready for the next jump.
Automation and Efficiency Enhancements

Automatic Re-Calibration after Jump: Detect when the jump is completed and automatically re-calibrate the script without requiring recompile or player intervention.
Intelligent Power Management: Add a feature that temporarily disables non-essential systems to allocate full power to the jump drive during a jump.
Sequence Automation: Allow preset sequences to initiate multiple jumps in succession, ideal for long-distance travel without player interaction.
Modular Customization and Integration

Multiple Jump Drives Control: Coordinate multiple jump drives on larger ships to perform synchronized or staggered jumps for enhanced precision and efficiency.
GPS Integration for Exact Coordinates: Allow the script to automatically calculate the optimal jump distance to reach a set GPS coordinate, reducing the need for manual adjustments.
Compatibility with Digi's Control Module (if available): Fully integrate with Digi’s Control Module to enhance hotkey-based distance adjustments, toggling, and additional control options.
Enhanced Error Handling and Stability

Auto-Resume after Game Save/Load: Automatically check and resume the script if the game is saved and reloaded mid-sequence, reducing the need for manual recompile.
Pre-Jump System Check: Conduct a check for necessary blocks and power requirements before initiating a jump, providing feedback if an issue is detected.
Fail-Safe Trigger: Implement a trigger to cancel the jump or revert distance if the ship unexpectedly loses power or mass changes, preventing jump anomalies.
Advanced Settings and Customization

User-Configurable Delay Tolerance: Allow players to set tolerance for delay, enabling smoother performance on high-lag servers.
Adjustable Feedback and Messaging: Customize notifications and feedback for jump sequences, such as short messages, alerts, and audio signals for successful or aborted jumps.
Debug Mode: Add an option to enable a debug mode, providing detailed logs of each jump and the script’s current state, to troubleshoot issues.
Potential New Applications and Functionalities
Long-Distance Jump Chains

Jump Chain Automation: For extended travel, configure the script to automatically chain multiple jumps to reach distant coordinates without needing to set each jump manually.
Auto-Jump Recalibration: Between jumps, the script could recalibrate based on the current position and remaining distance to destination, optimizing each jump for minimum travel time.
Enhanced Combat Maneuvering

Evasive Jump Patterns: Define sequences to make small jumps in a randomized pattern, useful for evasive maneuvers or rapid repositioning in combat scenarios.
Emergency Retreat Function: When triggered, automatically set the maximum jump distance and engage to evade danger, especially if enemy ships or high-damage events are detected.
Resource Management with Precision Jumps

Mining Operations Optimization: For mining vessels, automatically set a precise jump distance to align with specific resource deposits, reducing manual positioning time.
Cargo-Based Jump Adjustment: For haulers, adjust jump distances based on cargo load, optimizing power usage and travel efficiency based on ship mass changes during mining or cargo drop-offs.
Implementation and Setup Enhancements
Interactive Customization Interface

Configurable Jump Profiles in Custom Data: Store multiple jump profiles in the Custom Data section, allowing players to quickly switch between pre-defined jump setups (e.g., short-distance mining, long-range travel, emergency retreat).
Advanced Setup Wizard: Add a setup wizard that guides the user through initial configuration steps, with optional checks and adjustments based on the ship’s equipment and layout.
Detailed LCD Display Customization

Multi-Language Support: Allow users to set different languages for LCD displays and alerts, enhancing accessibility.
Customizable Visual Styles: Offer different visual themes for the LCD readouts, providing players with options for color schemes and layout styles.
