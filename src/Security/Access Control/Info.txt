Core Features and Enhancements
Flexible Security Levels and Profiles

Multiple Security Clearance Levels: Assign roles or clearance levels (e.g., guest, crew, officer, captain) that each have access to specific blocks or functionalities.
Profile Customization: Enable profiles to be defined with unique access parameters, allowing for tailored permissions for each user.
Auto-Adjusting Permissions: Allow permissions to dynamically update based on context, like proximity to sensitive areas, ship mode (combat, docked, etc.), or time elapsed since last interaction.
Advanced Code Entry and Management

Virtual Keypad: Display an on-screen keypad for code entry, allowing for a more user-friendly and secure entry system.
Randomized Keypad Layout: Shuffle key positions after each failed attempt to prevent pattern-based hacking.
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Integrate with biometric or personal ID scripts if available, or require codes from multiple profiles to gain high-level access.
Configurable Access Control for Blocks

Programmable Control List: Allow users to create lists of blocks that are restricted based on security level, such as engines, doors, weapon systems, and power sources.
Timed Access: Define access windows for specific blocks, ensuring certain functions are only available at certain times or states.
Emergency Override: Allow high-clearance users to force an emergency override on any togglable blocks, bypassing normal access levels when necessary.
Monitoring and Response Mechanisms

Attempt Logging Console: Record all access attempts, successful and failed, and display the information on a secure console.
Security Notifications: Send alerts when certain thresholds are crossed, such as multiple failed attempts, or unexpected access outside normal times.
Auto-Lockdown Protocol: After too many failed attempts or if unauthorized access is detected, initiate a lockdown mode where certain areas or blocks become inaccessible until reset by an admin.
Intrusion Detection and Response: Set an automatic response for failed attempts, such as triggering alarms, increasing shield output, or activating defense systems.
User Interface and Feedback

Status Console: Show live status updates on secured blocks, locked areas, or active users on a screen. Different views could be available based on clearance level.
Feedback Prompts: Display specific feedback to users based on their actions (e.g., “Access Denied,” “Try Again,” “System Locked”), to prevent confusion and encourage correct code entry.
Voice and Sound Integration: Use sound blocks or voice commands for specific events, like successful access, lockdown warnings, or unauthorized access detected.
Customizable Access Management Console

Admin Console for Profile and Code Management: A secure interface for adding, removing, and updating security profiles, codes, and permissions.
Remote Management Capabilities: Enable access and control from other programmable blocks or remote terminals on the ship, with admin-level permission.
Event Log Export: Include a function to export attempt logs, security responses, and any overrides to an external display or file for easy review.
Power-Integrated Security

Access-Based Power Allocation: Adjust power flow based on security status (e.g., lower power for non-critical systems when in lockdown).
Secure Power Reset: Include an option to cut power to specific areas or blocks if a security breach is detected, or to conserve resources during high-alert scenarios.
Additional Features for User-Friendly Experience
Real-Time Customization Without Code Editing

Use Custom Data fields for easy profile and block configuration, allowing users to adjust settings without delving into the script itself.
Preset Security Modes

Predefined settings for different scenarios (e.g., docked, combat, stealth) that adjust the permissions and security level requirements for all blocks.
Multi-Layer Security System for High-Security Blocks

Add an additional layer of security for the most critical functions, requiring multiple successful attempts or secondary confirmations for access.
