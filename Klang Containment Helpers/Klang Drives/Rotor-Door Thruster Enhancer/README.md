# Rotor-Door Thruster Enhancer

## Description
The Rotor-Door Thruster Enhancer is an advanced script designed to optimize the performance of Rotor-door thrusters in Space Engineers. This script transforms the Rotor-door thruster into a fully functional propulsion system, allowing for smoother movement, automatic dampening, and stable hovering in gravitational environments. 

### What is a Rotor-Door Engine?
A Rotor-door engine is a low-cost thrust generation system that utilizes the unique retractable properties of a rotor head to compress and exert force against a door block. This design allows for significant thrust generation with minimal electrical consumption. However, effective application of the Rotor-door engine requires careful placement along the ship's center of mass to avoid unbalanced deflection. 

## Features
- **Enhanced Stability Control**: The script now employs an advanced gyroscopic stabilization system that significantly mitigates deflection issues, allowing for improved control over the ship's orientation and movement.
  
- **Customizable Thrust Settings**: Users can now configure thrust output based on specific mission requirements. Adjust thrust levels directly from the control panel for more precise maneuverability.
  
- **Automated Control Features**: The script includes automatic damping adjustments based on the ship's velocity and altitude, ensuring optimal performance without user intervention.
  
- **User-Friendly Interface**: An intuitive control panel provides real-time feedback on thrust levels, stabilization status, and operational modes, making it easier to monitor the system's performance.
  
- **Safety Alerts**: Integrated safety alerts notify users when manual damping is recommended to prevent potential crashes or instability.

## Installation and Safe Use
1. **Add the Rotor-Door Engine**: Integrate a Rotor-door engine onto your spacecraft (you can add one to six engines as needed). Ensure they are positioned as close to the axis of the center of mass as possible. Reference: [PTB.CX500](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2625553175).
   
2. **Group the Engine Rotors**: Group all engine rotors and name the group "SRE-ALL" (this is the default name).
   
3. **Load the Script**: Place a computer on the ship and load the Rotor-Door Thruster Enhancer script.

4. **Adjust Damping Settings**: After stopping the ship in a gravity environment, remember to turn off automatic damping to prevent uncontrolled crashes.

## Important Notes
- The script is compatible only with the **Advanced Rotor** of the large block and the **Normal Rotor** of the small block. Other rotor types do not achieve bidirectional thrust.
  
- Ensure careful placement of the rotor-door engine along the ship's axis to minimize deflection issues.
